Kubernetes Micro
===================

### Descipriton: ###
This is a collection of tools used to deploy, setup and maintain a Kubernetes cluster. I plan on keeping this as updated as I can since I use it on my own small development cluster.

Inside each folder you'll find a specific README to know what you are looking at.

### Future Developments: ###

As said above I use this collection of tools/scripts myself so I plan on keeping the development up.

Currently I plan on adding:

- Deployment of Prometheus, Grafana and Loki with custom setting implemented through variables using ansible
- Deployment of Bitwarden and its configuration
- Deployment of Cert Manager and its configuration
